# Trading-Tests
All my quantitative finance projects

This project implements and explores various **technical analysis trading strategies** and their combinations, as well as regression-based models to assess their predictive power on future price movements.  

The code and methodologies are based on tutorials and educational content from **Sharp Research**, a content creator who teaches how to build these strategies in Python.
